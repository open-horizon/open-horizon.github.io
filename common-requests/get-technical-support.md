## Get Technical Support

To get technical support on Open Horizon, join the LF Edge [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/lfedge/shared_invite/zt-7kavdtmq-SeyFzM2CEABBcKYGEVCgkw) if you haven't.
Ensure you join the *#open-horizon-help* channel on LF Edge as you can post all technical and non-technical inquiries get a response from the help team.

See an example of a query below:

```Text
I have the OH Management Hub on one machine and the Agent on a Raspberry Pi.  I can run 'hzn exchange' commands (e.g. hzn exchange status) and get results back, but the agbot doesn't seem to be registered with the mgmt hub (hzn exchange agbot list on the mgmt hub is empty).  Is there documentation on the next steps to take to get the agent connected and configured with the hub and to perform a deployment of a container? ```
