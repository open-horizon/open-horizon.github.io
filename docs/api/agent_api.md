# Agent API
{: #agent_api}

{{site.data.keyword.horizon}} agent software runs on every edge node. Each agent is responsible for managing the software lifecycle of the services that are deployed on the edge node. With the REST API for the agent, you can locally configure the agent on the node by using the REST APIs at `http://localhost:8510`. The `hzn node` command interacts with those REST APIs.

For more information about these APIs, see [Local {{site.data.keyword.horizon}} APIs ![Opens in a new tab](../images/icons/launch-glyph.svg "Opens in a new tab")](https://github.com/open-horizon/anax/blob/master/docs/api.md).
