## Before you begin
{: #secrets_begin}

Complete the prerequisite steps in [Preparing to create an edge service](service_containers.md). As a result, these environment variables should be set, these commands should be installed, and these files should exist:

```bash
echo "HZN_ORG_ID=$HZN_ORG_ID, HZN_EXCHANGE_USER_AUTH=$HZN_EXCHANGE_USER_AUTH, DOCKER_HUB_ID=$DOCKER_HUB_ID"
which git jq make
ls ~/.hzn/keys/service.private.key ~/.hzn/keys/service.public.pem
cat /etc/default/horizon
```

## Procedure
{: #secrets_procedure}

This example is part of the [{{site.data.keyword.horizon_open}}](https://github.com/open-horizon/) open-source project. Follow the steps in [Creating Your Own Hello Secret Service](https://github.com/open-horizon/examples/blob/master/edge/services/helloSecretWorld/CreateService.md)) and then return here.
