# Multi-tenancy
{: #multit}

## Tenants in {{site.data.keyword.edge_notm}}
{: #tenants}

{{site.data.keyword.edge_notm}} ({{site.data.keyword.ieam}}) supports the general IT concept of multi-tenancy through organizations, where each tenant has their own organization. Organizations separate resources; therefore, users within each organization cannot create or modify resources in a different organization. Furthermore, resources in an organization can be viewed only by users in that organization, unless the resources are marked as public.

### Common use cases

Two broad use cases are used to leverage multi-tenancy in {{site.data.keyword.ieam}}:

* An enterprise has multiple business units, where each business unit is a separate organization in the same {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} management hub. Consider the legal, business, or technical reasons why each business unit ought to be a separate organization with its own set of {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} resources which are by default not accessible by the other business units. Note that even with separate organizations, the enterprise still has the option to use a common group of organization administrators to manage all of the organizations.
* An enterprise hosts {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} as a service for its customers, where each of their customers has one or more organizations in the management hub. In this case, the organization administrators are unique to each customer.

The use case you choose determines how you configure {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} and Identity and Access Manager ([IAM](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHKN6/iam/landing_iam.html)).

### Types of {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} users
{: #user-types}

{{site.data.keyword.ieam}} supports these user roles:

| **Role** | **Access** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Hub admin** | Manages the list of {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} organizations by creating, modifying, and deleting organizations as necessary, and by creating organization admins within each organization. |
| **Organization admin** | Manages the resources in one or more {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} organizations. Organization admins can create, view, or modify any resource (user, node, service, policy, or pattern) within the organization, even if they are not the owner of the resource. |
| **Regular user** | Creates nodes, services, policies, and patterns within the organization and modifies or deletes the resources that they have created. Views all of the services, policies, and patterns in the organization that other users have created. |

See [Role-based access control](../user_management/rbac.md) for a description of all {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} roles.

## The relationship between IAM and {{site.data.keyword.ieam}}
{: #iam-to-ieam}

The IAM (Identity and Access Manager) service manages users for all Cloud Pak based products, including {{site.data.keyword.ieam}}. IAM in turn uses LDAP to store the users. Each IAM user can be a member of one or more IAM teams. Because each IAM team is associated with an IAM account, an IAM user can indirectly be a member of one or more IAM accounts. See [IAM multi-tenancy](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHKN6/iam/3.x.x/multitenancy/multitenancy.html) for details.

The {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} exchange provides authentication and authorization services for the other {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} components. The exchange delegates the authentication of users to IAM, which means IAM user credentials are passed to the exchange and it relies on IAM to determine if they are valid. Each user role (hub admin, organization admin, or regular user) is defined in the exchange, and that determines the actions that users are allowed to perform in {{site.data.keyword.ieam}}.

Each organization in the {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} exchange is associated with an IAM account. Therefore IAM users in an IAM account are automatically members of the corresponding {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} organization. The one exception to this rule is that the {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} hub admin role is considered to be outside of any specific organization; therefore, it does not matter what IAM account the hub admin IAM user is in.

To summarize the mapping between IAM and {{site.data.keyword.ieam}}:

| **IAM** | **Relationship** | **{{site.data.keyword.ieam}}** |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| IAM Account | maps to | {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} Organization |
| IAM User | maps to | {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} User |
| There is no IAM counterpart for role | none | {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} role |
{: caption="Table 2. IAM - {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} mapping" caption-side="top"}

The credentials used to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} console are the IAM user and password. The credentials used for the {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} CLI (`hzn`) is an IAM API key.

## The initial organization
{: #initial-org}

By default, an organization was created during {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} installation with a name that you provided. If you do not need the multi-tenant capabilities of {{site.data.keyword.ieam}}, this initial organization is sufficient for your use of {{site.data.keyword.ieam}}, and you can skip the rest of this page.

## The IBM organization
{: #ibm-org}

The IBM organization is a unique organization that provides predefined services and patterns that are intended to be technology examples that are usable by any user in any organization. The IBM organization is automatically created when the {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} management hub is installed.

**Note:** Although the resources in the IBM organization are public, the IBM organization is not intended to hold all public content in the {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} management hub.

## Organization Configuration
{: #org-config}

Every {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} organization has the following settings. The default values for these settings are often sufficient. If you choose to customize any of the settings, run the command `hzn exchange org update -h` to see the command flags that can be used.

| **Setting** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `description` | A description of the organization. |
| `label` | The name of the organization. This value is used to display the organization name in the {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} management console. |
| `heartbeatIntervals` | How often edge node agents in the organization poll the management hub for instructions. See the following section for details. |
| `limits` | Limits for this organization. Currently the only limit is `maxNodes`, which is the maximum number of edge nodes allowed in this organization. There is a practical limit to the total number of edge nodes that a single {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} management hub can support. This setting enables the hub admin user to limit the number of nodes that each organization can have, which prevents one organization from using all of the capacity. A value of `0` means no limit. |

### Agent heartbeat polling interval
{: #agent-hb}

The {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} agent that is installed on every edge node periodically heartbeats to the management hub to let the management hub know it is still running and connected, and to receive instructions. You only need to change these settings for exceedingly high scale environments.

The heartbeat interval is the amount of time the agent waits between heartbeats to the management hub. The interval is adjusted automatically over time to optimize responsiveness and reduce the load on the management hub. The interval adjustment is controlled by three settings:

| **Setting** | **Description**|
|-------------|----------------|
| `minInterval` | The shortest amount of time (in seconds) the agent should wait between heartbeats to the management hub. When an agent is registered, it starts polling at this interval. The interval will never be less than this value. A value of `0` means use the default value. |
| `maxInterval` | The longest amount of time (in seconds) the agent should wait between heartbeats to the management hub. A value of `0` means use the default value. |
| `intervalAdjustment` | The number of seconds to add to the current heartbeat interval when the agent detects that it can increase the interval. After successfully heartbeating to the management hub, but receiving no instructions for some time, the heartbeat interval is gradually increased until it reaches the maximum heartbeat interval. Likewise, when instructions are received, the heartbeat interval is decreased to ensure that subsequent instructions are processed quickly. A value of `0` means use the default value. |
{: caption="Table 4. heartbeatIntervals settings" caption-side="top"}

The heartbeat polling interval settings in the organization are applied to nodes that have not explicitly configured the heartbeat interval. To check whether a node has explicitly set the heartbeat interval setting, use `hzn exchange node list <node id>`.

For more information about configuring settings in high-scale environments, see [Scaling Configuration](../hub/configuration.md#scale).
