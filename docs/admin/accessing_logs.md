# Accessing management hub logs
{: #accessing_logs}

## {{site.data.keyword.ocp_tm}} logging service
{: #ocp_logging}

To set up {{site.data.keyword.open_shift_cp}} a cluster logging service, see the documentation for the supported versions:

* [{{site.data.keyword.open_shift_cp}} 4.6 Cluster Logging](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/logging/cluster-logging.html)

**Notes:** 

* To install this service, you must adjust your cluster sizing. Follow the documented instructions to install a replicated Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) stack. 

* Elasticsearch requires significant memory and storage capacity.

## Basic logging

Each {{site.data.keyword.edge_notm}} ({{site.data.keyword.ieam}}) pod sends logs to STDOUT, so they can be read with the `oc logs` command. Basic logging capacity is limited, and log-rotation is based on time and log output quantity.

Determine the pod that you want to obtain the logs for:

```
oc get pods --namespace kube-system | grep ibm-edge
```
{: codeblock}

This sample shows truncated output.

```
$ oc get pods --namespace kube-system | grep ibm-edge
ibm-edge-agbot-5f96655f47-6g97f                           1/1     Running     0          5h16m
ibm-edge-agbot-5f96655f47-jzdfv                           1/1     Running     0          5h16m
ibm-edge-agbotdb-create-cluster-4mk7m                     0/1     Completed   0          7d
ibm-edge-agbotdb-creds-gen-rfhd2                          0/1     Completed   0          7d
ibm-edge-agbotdb-keeper-0                                 1/1     Running     0          7d

{: codeblock}

Tail the last 10 lines of the log for the first agbot pod in the previous list.

```
oc logs ibm-edge-agbot-5f96655f47-6g97f --tail=10
```
{: codeblock}

This sample shows an example of output.

```
$ oc logs ibm-edge-agbot-5f96655f47-6g97f --tail=10
